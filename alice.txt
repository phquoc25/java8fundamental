Streams are the key abstraction in Java 8 for processing collections of values and
specifying what you want to have done, leaving the scheduling of operations to
the implementation. For example, if you want to compute the average of the
values of a certain method, you specify that you want to call the method on each
element and get the average of the values. You leave it to the stream library to
parallelize the operation, using multiple threads for computing sums and counts
of each segment and combining the results.
